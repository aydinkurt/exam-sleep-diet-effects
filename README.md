# **Analyzing the Impact of Exam Periods on Sleep Patterns and Dietary Habits**

## **Project Overview**
This project explores the relationship between sleep patterns and dietary habits during high-stress periods, such as midterm exams. By analyzing personal data collected during midterms and the period after, the study aims to understand how exam stress affects sleep, caloric intake, and overall health. The findings will shed light on the interplay between disrupted sleep and dietary routines, offering actionable insights for maintaining health during stressful times.

### **Data Source**
- The data for this project is personally collected through manual logging.

### **Metrics**
The dataset includes the following metrics:
- **Daily Sleep Duration**: Number of hours slept each day.
- **Meal Status**: Whether meal was consumed (Yes/No).
- **Calorie Intake**: Total calories consumed during the day.
- **Time of Meals**: Timing of all meals throughout the day.

### **Collection Method**
- **Sleep Data**: Apple Watch tracking for duration and quality.
- **Dietary Data**: Manual logging of meal timings, caloric intake, and breakfast status.
- **Weight Data**: Daily weight logging.

### **Timeframe**
Data will be collected from:
- **Midterm Period**: 5-15 December 2024.
- **Post-Midterm Period**: 16-25 December 2024.

## **Core Objectives**
The project aims to:
1. Analyze how midterm exams impact sleep cycles and dietary habits.
2. Investigate the relationship between meal skipping, caloric intake, and sleep patterns.
3. Explore the shift in routine meal timings during high-stress periods.
4. Assess the overall health implications of disrupted routines during exam periods.

---

## **Key Research Questions**
1. How do midterm weeks impact sleep patterns?
2. How do midterms affect caloric intake?
3. Does skipping meals impact sleep patterns?
4. Does reduced sleep duration cause meal skipping?
5. How do exam periods shift the timing of routine meals?
6. What are the overall health effects (e.g., weight changes) of routine disruptions during exam periods?

## **Analysis Plan**
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize changes in sleep duration and meal timings during midterm and post-midterm periods.
   - Analyze trends in caloric intake and weight changes over time.

2. **Statistical Testing**:
   - Test for significant differences in sleep patterns, meal skipping, and caloric intake between midterm and post-midterm periods.
   - Correlation analysis to examine relationships between sleep, meal skipping, and caloric intake.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Bar charts visualizing total hours of sleep in a day.
   - Bar chart for meal(s) skipped during the day.
   - Weight information for each day during the period on a bar chart.

## **Findings**

### **Overview of Results**
The data analysis conducted in this project has yielded several key insights into how midterm exams affect students' sleep patterns and dietary habits. Below are the detailed findings:

### **1. Changes in Caloric Intake**
Our analysis reveals a significant reduction in daily caloric intake after the exam period. This decrease is particularly noticeable in the consumption of coffee and snacks, which were more frequently consumed during the study sessions leading up to exams. The heightened stress and increased study hours during the midterm period likely prompted students to consume more small meals and caffeinated beverages, which are known for their convenience and stimulative properties.

### **2. Sleep Patterns Adjustment**
The total sleep duration increased after the exams were completed. This change indicates a recovery phase where students catch up on sleep previously lost during the exam preparation period. Interestingly, the data suggest that the reduction in sleep during exams was more due to earlier wake-up times rather than delayed bedtimes. Students getting up early to study could be a factor that significantly reduced sleep duration, as opposed to staying up late.

### **3. Meal Skipping and Sleep Correlation**
There is a correlation between meal skipping and altered sleep patterns. During the exam period, not only did caloric intake decrease, but the timing and frequency of meals also changed, with more meals being skipped. This irregularity in eating habits may further disrupt sleep patterns, compounding the stress effects of exams.

### **4. Health Implications**
The shift in routine meals and sleep patterns during exams has notable implications for students' overall health. The data indicate a cycle of reduced caloric intake and sleep during high-stress academic periods followed by a compensatory increase in both after exams conclude. This cycle can lead to increased physical and emotional stress and may affect academic performance and well-being.
